1.  I have read the 4 criteria for Free Software
2.  Licensing your software gives several benefits for yourself and for the users, by making clear what each party is 
    allowed to do. Should you want to profit from the distribution of your software, a license can give you solid legal
    grounds from which to do so. Alternatively, if you want your software to be free for distribution and modification,
    applying a free license makes it clear to users that they can do so without reprecussion and without violating your
    intent.
3.  Without a license, this implicit communication will not occur, leaving both you and the users open to potential 
    exploitation from the other party. If an unlicensed project suddenly takes on a license containing, say, an NDA, 
    this hurts the trust of users that accepted the project as something to share.
4.  I agree with this claim, though, as the article later points out, there is likely no unitary reason why Gopher failed.
    The licensing issue is definately part of it, though. By limiting commercial access, and requiring an arbitrary
    dilineation between commercial interests and educational interests, Gopher became less free to use. The increased
    legal overhead would tend to turn away individual hackers that might want to try a hand in web development.
5.  Since Android is developed by a large company with significant legal clout, it is important that they guarantee their
    community developers a degree of protection from patent claims against their projects. The Apache licence allows for 
    open source development, and provides a degree of pretection for the developers that the flavors of GPL and MIT lack.
6.  Our group decided on the Apache license.
7.  For an individual developer the Apache license provides a modicum of legal protection. For a company, the LGPL lisence
    allows for proprietary development. For the common good, nothing is more free than GPL.
8.  Okay, I'll do that.
9.  I'd still like to use the project I outlined last time, though I will keep myself open to other ideas as the semester 
    progresses. As my above statements might indicate, I am partial to the Apache lisence, though the GPL license is also
    an option. I don't know who my partners would be. Whom so ever might be interested, I suppose.
