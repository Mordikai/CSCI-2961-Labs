10. I've had a project spinning around in my head for about a year now. The idea came from some shallow experimentation
    with chiptune music in high school. I never really made music, but instead, missing the point to some degree, I tried
    to emulate real instruments as close as I could by combining the basic square, triangle, and noise channels. About a year
    ago, it occured to me that I might be able to write a program to perform this decomposition, seperating a waveform into
    a given number of basic channels that approximate the input as closely as possible. It's likely that I will end up
    pursuing this idea for my project, if I can.
