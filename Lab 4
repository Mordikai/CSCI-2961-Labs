I chose to look for a type in the FreeBSD documentation. After some time reading through the handbook, I came accross a sentence that felt like it needed an 'either'.
On line 3600 of 'disks\chapter.xml', I found the following sentence:
	The administrator must decide which node has more important changes or merge them manually.
I clarified the phrasing a little:
	The administrator must either decide which node has more important changes, or perform the merge manually.
